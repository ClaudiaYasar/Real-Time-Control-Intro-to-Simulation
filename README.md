# Real-Time-Control-Intro-to-Simulation
This work delves into integrating Simulink and Simscape with MATLAB, covering symbolic math for system representation conversion, creating models for a DC Motor, and building a Simscape model for a motor joint. It also discusses proficiency strategies and virtual hardware for control applications.
